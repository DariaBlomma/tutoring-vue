  </h1>
  <p>
    The
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='recognition'
    />
    of Donetsk and Luhansk as "independent" has been met
    with widespread
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='condemnation'
    />
    from the West
    amid fears it could provide a pretext for a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Russian President Vladimir Putin has
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='recognized'
    />
    the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
    He made the announcement in a televised speech to the nation on Monday night.
    The Russian leader
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='signed a decree'
    />
    recognizing the self-proclaimed "Donetsk People's Republic" (DPR)
    and the "Luhansk People's Republic" (LPR)
    as
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='independent'
    /> .
  </p>
  <p>
    The move
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='has escalated'
    />
    fears among Western nations about a Russian
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='invasion'
    />
    of Ukraine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hours after the announcement, Putin instructed the Defense Ministry to
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='send troops'
    />
    into the territories for what the Kremlin called "the function of peacekeeping."
  </p>
  <p>
    In a long, fiery address, Putin said he was confident
    the Russian people would
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='support'
    />
    his decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Monday's developments came amid an uptick of
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='violence'
    />
    in the
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='long-running'
    />
    conflict between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian rebels.
  </p>
  <p>
    German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron have
    " <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='expressed disappointment'
    /> "
    in phone calls with Putin.
  </p>
  <p>
    German Chancellor Olaf Scholz
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='warned'
    />
    Moscow against the action, saying it would be "a unilateral breach"
    of the 2015 peace deal for the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
    In a phone call with Putin late Monday, Scholz urged Russia to "immediately
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='deescalate'
    />
    and
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='withdraw the forces'
    />
    from the borders to Ukraine."
  </p>
  <p>
    British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the recognition was
    "plainly in breach of
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='international law'
    />
    " and a "flagrant
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='violation'
    />
    of the
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='sovereignity'
    />
    and integrity of Ukraine."

    "The UK will
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='continue'
    />
    to do everything we can to stand by the people of Ukraine
    with a very robust package of sanctions," he told a press conference.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Moscow continues to fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine by
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='providing'
    />
    financial and military
    <InputAnswer
      readyFullWord='support to the separatists'
    />.
    It is also trying to stage a pretext to invade Ukraine once again."
